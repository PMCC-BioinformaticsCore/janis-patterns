"""
Sometimes a tool will give us an output type that isn't exactly what we expect.
For example, a tool might return a File (like "cat"), but you actually know it'll
return a TextFile because you know the input.

Usually, your subsequent tools will throw a type warning, as:
    File -> TextFile (incompatible)
